The Over the Scope Clip (OTSC,Ovesco AG, Germany) system is a new tool for the endoscopic entrapment of tissue. Indications for its use are hemostasis, compression of large vessels, and closure of leaks or fistulas of the GI tract. Preclinical work has shown the device to be feasible and safe for the closure of gastric, duodenal and colonic perforations up to 20 mm in diameter (1,2).
