Schematic diagram of sealing of a fistula by either surgical suturing (upper panel) or by application of an OTSC clip (lower panel). In case of subsiding oedema (grey shaded area), the suture releases its impact on the healing tissue giving rise to a reopening of the wound margins. Thin grey arrows indicate movement of the shrinking tissue relative to the closing force of sutures or the clip, respectively. In contrast, the clip imposes a permanent pressure (bold black arrows) onto the fistula orifice despite topographical changes of the wound margins.
